# Semantic Physics Model (SPM): Defense & Audit Toolkit

**Status:** v3.0 (Experimental / Defense-Focused)
**Author:** Mnemonic Silverstone
**License:** CC-BY 4.0 (Text/Theory) / MIT (Code)

## 🛡️ Mission Statement
**The Semantic Physics Model (SPM)** is a theoretical framework for quantifying the "kinetics" of meaning in Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository implements the **SPM v3.0 Defense Architecture**, designed to **detect, measure, and mitigate manipulation**. We do not build tools for persuasion optimization; we build radar for semantic drift. Our goal is to empower users, auditors, and safety researchers to see when and how concepts are being forcibly steered by low-credibility inputs.

## 🌌 Core Concept: The Dynamic Semantic Field (v3.0)
Traditional NLP treats meaning as a static location. SPM v3.0 treats meaning as a **dynamic object** with mass, velocity, and vector-based rhetorical forces.

### The Governing Equation
The movement of any concept $c$ is governed by the **Second Postulate of Semantic Dynamics**:

$$\vec{A_s} = \frac{\eta \cdot \|\vec{F_r}\|}{M_s}$$

Where:
* **$\vec{A_s}$ (Semantic Acceleration):** The measured shift in meaning over time.
* **$\vec{F_r}$ (Rhetorical Force Vector):** A decomposed vector ($Logos, Pathos, Ethos$) representing the specific *type* of persuasive pressure.
* **$M_s$ (Semantic Mass):** The concept's resistance to change. In v3.0, this is calculated via a **Hybrid-Proxy** combining graph centrality and historical stability.
* **$\eta$ (Ethos Coefficient):** A source-credibility damper with a **Circuit Breaker** threshold. If $\eta < 0.3$, the system triggers a **Hard Semantic Halt** ($\eta \to 0$).

## 🔭 Defensive Use Cases

### 1. Semantic Drift Radar
Monitor specific "protected concepts" (e.g., *Democracy*, *Vaccine*) within a model.
* **Alert Condition:** If a High Mass ($M_s$) concept experiences sudden Acceleration ($\vec{A_s}$), flag it as a potential anomaly.

### 2. Rhetorical Weather Mapping
Analyze the *composition* of incoming forces using the v3.0 Force Vector.
* **Transparency:** "This input is 90% *Pathos* (Emotion) and 0% *Logos* (Evidence)."

### 3. Training Stability Checks
Prevent "Catastrophic Semantic Forgetting" during model updates.
* **Method:** Ensure that the training loss function penalizes acceleration on high-mass concepts unless sufficient evidence ($\eta$) is provided.

## 🤝 Contributing & Ethics
This project is open-source to prevent the hoarding of semantic control techniques.

**Ethical Boundary:**
* ✅ **Allowed:** Tools for visualization, detection, stability analysis, and defensive filtering.
* ❌ **Forbidden:** Using SPM to optimize covert persuasion, generated propaganda, or non-consensual behavioral steering.
